# Problem_Set_11

In this week's problem set we will be conducting a PCA on human SNP data.

There are several pre-processing steps that I conducted that I will outline below. 

### Pre-processing 1 - Get a specific region of Chromosome 19

Due to time and processor constraints we will be anlayzing only a small portion of Human Chromosome 19 

I started with a VCF file of all positions in Chr 19 in the 1000 Genomes data VCF. This involves using **VCFtools**
